# PaineScans

First, type the IP address of your SQL database. This is found at 
	System Preferences -> Network -> Advanced -> IPv4 Address

Once this has been input, scan a barcode of book and submit. 

Troubleshooting:
	If the scan says "Found Product", this particular ISBN isn't found in the National Library of Australia's database, so it will have to put in manually via the application.

	The scanning phone and the server MUST be on the same router.
